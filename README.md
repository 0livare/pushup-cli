# pushup-cli ðŸ’ª

Automatically push remote git branches that follow your team's standard.

## Why?

Teams often create rules about the format of their branch names. The goal is usually to be able to identify who created the branch, or to be able to correlate the branch with a ticket number in your ticketing system (e.g. Jira). For example:

```bash
zp/my-branch # Where zp are someone's initials
MLD-419-add-graphql-support # Where MLD-419 is a ticket number
zp-NVM-8907-supportAdditionalProviders
```

To follow this standard, devs will often create a local branch in that format and then just push it up like normal. But as you've probably found (if you've made your way here), that method has some drawbacks:

- It's super repetitive
- For some reason it's always harder than it should be to remember the damn format you're supposed to use
- Your branch names become long and a pain to type
- Even terminal auto-complete can't help very much because the repetitive part of the branch name tends to be at the beginning, and for auto-complete to work you at least have to type it out until you get to a unique portion of the branch name.

**pushup-cli** solves that problem by allowing you to create a short local branch name, and automatically publishing a remote branch name that meets your teams standards.

## Getting Started

1. Install `pushup` globally with either npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   # Install with NPM
   npm i -g pushup-cli

   # Or install with yarn
   yarn global add pushup-cli
   ```

2. Create a [configuration file](#configuration-file) by running `pushup init` and following the prompts.

3. Now, pushing a remote branch is as simple as

   ```bash
   âžœ  git checkout -b myBranch
   Switched to a new branch 'myBranch'

   âžœ  pushup 123 # Where 123 is your ticket number
   Branch 'myBranch' set up to track remote branch 'zp-NVM-123-myBranch' from 'origin'.
   ```

## Configuration File

> ðŸ’¡ The `pushup init` command will create a configuration file for you via interactive prompts

### Config file location

pushup uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig#cosmiconfig) for configuration file support. This means you can configure pushup via [any standard configuration method](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig#cosmiconfig).

You can place your config file directly in your project so that your whole team can take advantage of it, or in your home directory for your personal use.

If configs are found both within the project and in your home directory, then both will be used, with precedence given to the project config.

Placing a config directly in a project is nice because it allows customizing the ticket prefix on a per-project basis. You can also customize config values via the [CLI options](#CLI-Commands) each time you run a command. If your team is not using pushup but you need to support multiple projects, (after reminding your teammates they're wasting their valuable time) take a look at the [projects](#Projects) section below.

### Config file contents

Your configuration file may contain the following keys:

- `format` _(default: `TICKET-BRANCH`)_ - The format of the remote branch name to be pushed. It can optionally accept certain placeholders that will be replaced with calculated values. All text that does not match a placeholder will not be modified and will become part of the remote branch name.

  The currently supported placeholders are:

  - `TICKET`: Will be replaced with the parsed ticket number
  - `BRANCH`: Will be replaced with the name of your currently checked out local branch
  - `INITIALS`: Will be replaced with the `initials` config value. This is useful for teams sharing the same `format`.

  Here are some example formats:

  ```
  INITIALS/BRANCH
  TICKET-BRANCH
  foo-TICKET-BRANCH-bar
  ```

- `ticketPrefix` _(default: `""`)_ - The prefix that appears at the beginning of all of your ticket numbers. This prefix is typically used to identify which project a particular ticket is associated with.

  For example, if this is set to `FOO-`, the command `pushup 44` will result in BRANCH (one of the `format` placeholders) being equal to `FOO-44`.

  > If your ticket numbers contain a divider (like a dash "-" for example), make sure that divider is included in your `ticketPrefix`.

  This prefix can also be supplied all at once along with your ticket ID, like `pushup BAR-123`. Doing so will cause `ticketPrefix` to be ignored.

- `gitRemote` _(default: `origin`)_ - The name of the git remote that should be pushed to.

- `ticketUrl` (_default: `""`)_ - The URL of a ticket in your ticketing system. You must include `TICKET` somewhere in this URL as a placeholder for the ticket number that is being opened.

  If you're using Jira as your ticking system for example, this might look something like:

  ```json
  "ticketUrl": "https://company.atlassian.net/browse/TICKET"
  ```

- `initials` _(default: `""`)_ - The initials of your name. If provided, this is used to fill the INITIALS placeholder in the `format` option.

> Note: When using a project level config file, you can also create a config file in your home directory that contains your initials.

### Projects

If you are using pushup but your team isn't, supporting multiple projects can prove difficult. The standard solution to support multiple projects is to create a config file that the entire team shares inside each repository. Because you need to add a config file to the repo though, that requires sign-off from your team.

For situations where you don't have that team sign-off, you can create a config file in your home directory that contains a `projects` object. The keys of `projects` are file paths to projects, and the values are entire config objects, as described in [config file contents](#config-file-contents) above.

See [.pushuprc SAMPLE.json](https://github.com/zposten/pushup-cli/blob/main/.pushuprc%20SAMPLE.json) for an example.

## CLI Commands

Many CLI options also have an identically named config value. Please see the [config file contents](#config-file-contents) section for more information about each option.

### `pushup [ticket]`, `pushup create [ticket]`

> This is the default command, and is identical to just running `pushup [ticket]`.

Automatically create remote git branches that follow your team's standard.

As stated above, the simplest usage of the CLI is just `pushup 44`, where `44` is your ticket identifier. This wil be combined with either your configuration file or the default options to publish a remote branch.

Supports the following options:

- `--delete`, `-d`(Synonym for`pushup delete` command)
- `--format`
- `--gitRemote`, `-r`
- `--help`
- `--initials`, `-i`
- `--ticket`, `-t` (identical to `[ticket]` argument)
- `--ticketPrefix`, `-p`

Any unknown options will be passed along to `git`.

### `pushup delete [ticket]`

Automatically delete the remote git branch corresponding to a particular ticket number. If a ticket number is not supplied, a best guess is made and suggested to you when possible.

Supports the following options:

- `--format`
- `--gitRemote`, `-r`
- `--help`
- `--initials`, `-i`
- `--ticket`, `-t` (identical to `[ticket]` argument)
- `--ticketPrefix`, `-p`

Any unknown options will be passed along to `git`.

### `pushup init`

Create a pushup config file via interactive prompts.

Supports the following options:

- `--format`
- `--gitRemote`, `-r`
- `--help`
- `--initials`, `-i`
- `--ticketPrefix`, `-p`

### `pushup open [ticket]`

Open a ticket in your web browser. Requires a `ticketUrl` either in your config file or supplied as a CLI option.

Supports the following options:

- `--format`
- `--help`
- `--initials`, `-i`
- `--ticket`, `-t` (identical to `[ticket]` argument)
- `--ticketPrefix`, `-p`
- `--ticketUrl`, `-u`

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo
1. Create a [configuration file](#configuration-file) by running `pushup init` and following the prompts
1. Install dependencies with: `yarn install`
1. Allow running `pushup` in the terminal to run invoke project: `npm link`
   - _Yarn's link command does not respect the `bin` field in the package.json currently_
1. Run `pushup 123` in your terminal inside of a git repo. A remote branch should have been created!
   1. If you get "permission denied" when running the `pushup` command, run `yarn execute` inside this project and then try again
